'''
Spin flip TDA (TDDFT) graditnt. The kwarg 'extype' is used to control which
kind of excited energy to be calculated, 0 for spin flip up, 1 for
spin flip down.

Note: pyscf.sftda_grad is implemented under the spin-flip TDDFT framework,
that can deal with both spin-flip TDA and TDDFT results. However, the Davi-
dson solver to spin-flip TDDFT hasn't been implemented, and no direct exam-
ples are displayed here.
