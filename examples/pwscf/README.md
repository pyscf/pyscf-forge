# Plane-Wave Mode
The `pyscf.pbc.pwscf` module provides experimental support for Hartree-Fock (HF), density functional theory (DFT), second-order M\o ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2), and coupled cluster singles doubles (CCSD) in a plane-wave basis. The CCECP and GTH pseudopotentials are supported for these methods, and SG15 pseudopotentials are supported for HF and DFT calculations. Occupation smearing and symmetry reduction of k-point meshes are implemented for HF and DFT.
